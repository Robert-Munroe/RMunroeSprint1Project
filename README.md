a brief description of what your project does

This project pulls various types of data from an API and writes it to a file.

a brief description of what is missing from the project (if anything)

I might be missing something related to pages. 
I don't really understand this line: "MAKE SURE YOU get all the pages of data â€“ by default it comes in 20 at a time. You need all 3000+ entries"
